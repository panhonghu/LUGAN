Lower-Upper Generative Adversarial Network, a geometry-based multi-view pose generation pipeline.

As can be seen, by column 1 and column 3, the cross-view intra-class variance is much larger than inter-class variance under the same view. To this end, we propose to generate multi-view pose sequences for each single-view pose sample. The cross-view pose generation is achieved by learning a linear transformation matrices $Q$, which exploits the spatial geometric relationship between cross-view poses.
